# (T&A-CV) CDD through Prompt2Guard on expanded dataset

## 1. Overview
This is the repository for the project on **deep fake images detection** of the course "Trends and Applications in Computer Vision".
Specifically, the **Continual Deepfake Detection(CDD)** problem which has become a prominent topic after the more and more rapid development of **generative models** in the image and video field. 

For this task, we explored various methods, focusing not only on accuracy but also on other relevant factors such as code availability and implementation costs, identifying the model and approach that best align with our needs. 
We choose to adopt [Prompt2Guard](https://github.com/laitifranz/Prompt2Guard), which achieves state of the art performances on the CDDB Hard benchmark with relatively limited amount of available data.
